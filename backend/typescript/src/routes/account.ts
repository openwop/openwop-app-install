/**
 * Account management routes (P3.6.5).
 *
 *   DELETE /v1/host/sample/account   — hard delete the caller's data
 *
 * Hard delete wipes:
 *   - every row owned by the caller's user:* tenant (runs, events,
 *     interrupts, workflows, byok_tenant_secrets)
 *   - cached tenant secrets in the in-process resolver
 *
 * Firebase user revocation is the caller's responsibility — the SPA
 * follows the backend DELETE with `user.delete()` on the Firebase JS
 * SDK. We don't pull in firebase-admin server-side because:
 *   (a) it's a heavyweight dep with native modules,
 *   (b) the JS SDK already does the right thing with the user's own
 *       fresh ID token, no service-account credentials needed,
 *   (c) defense-in-depth: server-side data deletion is independent of
 *       Firebase availability.
 *
 * Audit: every deletion writes one row to `audit_log` with the row
 * counts. The audit log itself is NOT cleared — security-relevant
 * events outlive the account by design.
