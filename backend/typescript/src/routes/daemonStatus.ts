/**
 * CLI-friendly daemon-status endpoint.

 * Namespace: host-extension under `/v1/host/openwop-app/*`; this is not
 * part of the normative OpenWOP wire contract. It gives the CLI's
 * `demo {status,stop,restart}` commands and `doctor` a real readiness
 * signal for the running demo backend: process id, when it started, how
 * long it has been up, and the timestamp of the most recent observed
 * activity (used as a lightweight liveness/heartbeat marker).
