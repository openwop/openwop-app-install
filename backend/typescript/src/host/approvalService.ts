/**
 * Pending-approval queue — host extension (sample-grade, non-normative).
 *
 * The reference implementation of the "agents propose, humans dispose" gate.
 * When a roster member runs at `autonomyLevel: 'review'` (host/rosterService.ts)
 * its heartbeat does NOT start the picked run; it queues a PendingApproval here
 * describing the proposed action (which workflow, on which board card). A human
 * reviews the proposal in the approvals inbox and either:
 *   - CLAIMS it — an affirmative sign-off that starts the proposed run, OR
 *   - REJECTS it — the proposal is dismissed and the card stays in To Do.
 *
 * This is a PRE-EXECUTION gate, deliberately distinct from the normative
 * `interrupt` kind (interrupt.md), which suspends a run that is already
 * in flight. The propose moment in this sample is the heartbeat's pick
 * decision — before any run exists — so a lightweight durable queue models it
 * more honestly than forcing every demo workflow to carry an approval node.
 *
 * Read-through, per-entity durable store (host/hostExtPersistence.ts): safe
 * across instances + restart-durable, like the roster/kanban surfaces.
