/**
 * Tracks when we last got a successful response from the openwop
 * backend. The chat-tab cold-start card reads this to decide
 * whether to open with "warm" copy (recent success → assume the
 * Cloud Run container is still alive) or "cold" copy (no recent
 * success → assume the container was evicted and we're cold-starting).
 *
 * Persisted to localStorage so the prediction survives a tab close.
 *
 * The network recorder calls `recordLastSuccess()` on every 2xx
 * response that hits the OpenWOP backend; the card reads
 * `getLastSuccessAt()` on mount to choose its initial phase.
 *
 * Cloud Run evicts cpu=1 containers after ~15 minutes of no traffic
 * (with `min-instances=0`), so the "warm" window we trust is ~5
 * minutes — generous enough to cover quick tab-switches, tight
 * enough to bias toward the honest cold-start copy when the user
 * comes back from a long break.
