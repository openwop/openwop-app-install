/**
 * Minimal, dependency-free runtime guards for UNTRUSTED and host-extension
 * responses (GAP-ANALYSIS A-2 / E4).
 *
 * Scope (per the architect review): *core* protocol shapes stay validated by
 * the `@openwop/openwop` SDK — we do NOT fork them with a second schema layer.
 * These guards are only for surfaces the SDK does not own: the registry
 * (`packs.openwop.dev`, a different, untrusted origin) and the demo host's
 * `/v1/host/openwop-app/*` extension endpoints, which are cast `as T` from raw
 * fetch. A malformed payload here previously crashed three components deep
 * (e.g. `.map()` on a non-array); these turn it into one typed error the page
 * error states / app error boundary can render.
