/**
 * Unified cold-start / error card for the AI chat surface.
 *
 * Replaces the previous two-card flow (loading → error) that flashed
 * "Spinning up your server…" → "The server is resting" as separate
 * screens. The user perceived that as a confusing arc ("you said you
 * were starting, then you gave up").
 *
 * Now: ONE card that adapts its copy over time and on error. Three
 * phases drive the same chrome:
 *
 *   Phase 1 — Loading, predict warm (recent success in localStorage):
 *     "Loading…" with subtle dots. Should resolve in <1s.
 *
 *   Phase 1 — Loading, predict cold (no recent success):
 *     "Waking up the server…" with cold-start framing in the
 *     body. Users expect 10-30s.
 *
 *   Phase 2 — Loading, elapsed ≥ 25s:
 *     "Still waking up…" — copy softens; explicit acknowledgment that
 *     this is taking longer than typical but not yet a failure.
 *
 *   Phase 3 — Error OR elapsed ≥ 40s:
 *     "The server is resting" + refresh-instruction copy. Same chrome,
 *     same card position — copy + dot animation change only.
 *
 * The shared chrome means the user sees ONE evolving card instead of
 * the previous two-card flash. The phase boundaries are tunable in
 * the constants below.
