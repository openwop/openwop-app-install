/**
 * ReasoningDisclosure — RFC 0030 §A `envelope.payload.reasoning` surface.
 *
 * The model ships a post-hoc explanation alongside its structured answer
 * (distinct from `agent.reasoning.delta` thinking-tokens, which are the
 * model's *internal monologue stream* — those are surfaced by
 * ThoughtsDisclosure with a "…" icon). This disclosure uses a different
 * icon ("ⓘ" — info) to signal "why this answer" rather than "what the
 * model was thinking on the way there".
 *
 * Collapsed by default. Rendered under the assistant message body when
 * the envelope payload carries `reasoning` and the string is non-empty.
 *
 * @see RFCS/0030-envelope-reasoning-and-tier-one-subset.md §A
 * @see spec/v1/ai-envelope.md §"Reasoning field (normative)"
