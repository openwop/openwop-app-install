/**
 * Empty-state welcome card (inner-content redesign 2026-06-05). Pivots from
 * "ask the LLM about OpenWOP" to the actual differentiator: run a multi-step
 * workflow with `/`, or hand a task to a named agent with `@`.
 *
 * All four cards are REAL slash invocations of the seeded premade templates —
 * clicking pre-fills the composer with `/slug` + a representative input so
 * Send dispatches a real run. Below them, the agent pills hand the chat to a
 * named roster persona (`@nora `). No fabricated badges: there is no usage
 * telemetry, so nothing claims "most used".
