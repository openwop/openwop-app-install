/**
 * A2APeerPanel — placeholder for the A2A composition pairing with the
 * already-shipped `McpToolsPanel`.
 *
 * `spec/v1/a2a-integration.md` (FINAL v1.1, 2026-05-05) documents how
 * an openwop host can expose itself as an A2A agent (each Workflow →
 * an `AgentSkill`, each run → a `Task`) and how an openwop client can
 * dispatch into a remote A2A peer. But:
 *
 *   - the capability advertisement shape is still a candidate
 *     (`{supported: boolean, agentCardUrl: string}` is the leading
 *     candidate per `a2a-integration.md` §"Capability advertisement");
 *   - `capabilities.schema.json` does NOT yet define a `capabilities.a2a`
 *     block;
 *   - the reference host does NOT expose itself as an A2A agent and
 *     no `core.a2a.*` NodeModule is registered;
 *   - no non-steward host publishes an A2A AgentCard yet.
 *
 * So this panel does the only honest thing the reference app can do
 * today: tell the operator that A2A peer discovery is not yet
 * advertised, point at the spec, and point at the round-2 handoff
 * (`docs/myndhyve-round-2-handoff.md` §3) that asks MyndHyve to publish
 * an A2A peer endpoint — which would convert this panel from a
 * placeholder into a real peer browser.
 *
 * The MCP companion (`McpToolsPanel`) renders right above it on
 * `/capabilities`, so the operator sees the paired surface even
 * though one side is not yet implementable end-to-end.
